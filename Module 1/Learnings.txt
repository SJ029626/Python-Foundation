So In this module I learned the difference between python 2.7 and 3.x
=> Python 2.7 is used for production development and many companies are using it today also.
=> Python3.x is used for new development.

"#!/bin/python" => It is used to tell that the program we are running is of python.
Also There is a command called "which Python" which will tell you what is the location of your bin python like
"#!/usr/bin/python3"
we can also use it.
Remember the python is an interpreter language.

cat /etc/*release
will tell you the current version of ubuntu and if it is not current then use
sudo apt-get update && upgrade
Your current version will be updated.

So run python in terminal it will tell you the currrent version you have installed in the system.

python3 is by default installed in ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver that I am using.

So If you want python 2.7, then write
sudo apt-get -y install python2.7 python-pip or
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip

If you want to install sshd
sudo apt install openssh-server.
